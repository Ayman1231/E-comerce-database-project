Description:
We implemented the database in phpMyAdmin and connected it with PhP. The project
in general is an ecommerce website that sells a lot of things to users and it is controlled
by database. The website views a lot of categories with different products that have
different models with different featured items. In our website we have two parts, the
admin part and the user part.
 The admin part:
controls everything in our website.
The admin can:
 (add, delete, edit, view) the categories.
 (add, delete, edit, view) products.
 (add, delete, edit, view) models.
 (add, delete, edit, view) items and add new features to them, remove them,
edit them or add new colors or delete them.
 Moreover, the admin can add new branches and (Add, delete) phone
numbers to branch.
We can add new accounts to admin so that many accounts with different names, emails
and passwords can control the database and edit it.

 The user part:
 It‟s what the user sees.
 It is divided into:
 Categories (electronics, fashion, perfumes and accessories).
 Each category has different Products (mobiles, laptops, t-shirts and shoes).
 Each product has different Models (iPhone 6s mobile and Lenovo YZ Laptop).
 Each Model has different items for it (iPhone 6s 16GB gold color, iPhone 6s
32GB pink color).
Each user creates an account and login with his email and password and decide which
branch of the store he wants to deal with.
After making an account the user can:
 Add items to “wish list” that contains all the item the user wishes to buy
some time later.
 Add items to his shopping cart that shows later the total price of the items
with details about the user and the shipping address.
 The website also shows all info about all branches with a contact us page.
